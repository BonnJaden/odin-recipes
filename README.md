# odin-recipes
This project applies all of the HTML knowledge learned thus far. 
The goal of this project is to create a basic website containing various recipes.

Self reflection:
In this project, I have demonstrated many skills:
- Created an HTML website from scratch via the boilerplate framework.
- Utilized <a href> element to move between recipes.
- Implemented <img src> element to add visuals to the website and corresponding recipes.
- Organized website using headings, paragraphs, and lists.
